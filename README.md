# Plain Javascript Line Graph
The fastest possible javascript + svg line graph you will be able to find, it's just math.

## Functionality
get_graph([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100]) will return an svg with the top point being 100 and the bottom point being 10. The result is an HTML5 SVG that is fully fluid.
